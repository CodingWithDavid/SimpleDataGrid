## Why

I have a reoccurring use case to for a simple data grid in many of my applications.  There are several good data grids for Blazor available that have a lot of features and can display millions of records.  My needs are not that advance, simple functionality and less than 1000 records.  Just enough that a regular table is not enough, and the full data grids are a little overkill.
